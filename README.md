Module 3 Python Challenge
PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

*Both assignments should output  a text file with the results

Note: PyBank assignment was done with the help of a tutor. Also used resources such as Slack, Python help pages to find specific code such as outputting the file text, /n, min and max, and round. PyPoll assignment was done with the same help as above minus the tutor- used PyBank assignment as a guide to complete PyPoll assingment. Also used the XPert Learning Assistant.
